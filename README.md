# Vibe-to-Spec Forecaster: Global Flashpoints 2026-2030

> **A case study in Spec-Driven Development (SDD) and Geopolitical Knowledge Distillation.**

This repository contains:

1. A **specification** of a software system designed to distill open-source intelligence into actionable forecasts regarding global **Power Centers** and **Geopolitical Flashpoints** for the 2026–2030 window. The unique aspect of this project is its lifecycle: it originated as a "vibe-coded" experimental prototype and was matured into specification through a **Vibe-to-Spec Pivot**.

2. The forecasts generated by the system for the 2026–2030 window.

## The Methodology: Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

In the era of AI-native engineering, "vibe-coding" allows for rapid discovery of logic. However, robustness requires structure. This project follows the **SDD** approach:

1.  **Vibe Phase:** Initial prototyping of the distillation engine and data scrapers.
2.  **The Pivot:** Extraction of logic, requirements, and system architecture into a formal [SPECIFICATION](specification/README.md).
3.  **Implementation:** Now you can use the specification to build the system in your favourite language with your favourite tools like Windsurf, Claude Code, or Cursor.

## Project Scope: Geopolitical Distillation

The system analyzes open resources (think-tank reports, economic data, regional news) to identify:
* **Power Centers:** Emerging economic and military hubs.
* **Flashpoints:** High-risk states or regions predicted to face volatility between 2026 and 2030.
* **Knowledge Distillation:** Using LLMs to synthesize high-density geopolitical data into low-latency strategic insights.

## Repository Structure

* `/forecasts`: The forecasts generated by the system for the 2026–2030 window.
* `/specification`: The specification of the system, which can be used to build the system in your favourite language with AI-native tools.
